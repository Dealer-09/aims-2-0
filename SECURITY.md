## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular dependency updates

### For Deployment
- Use HTTPS only
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Set secure headers
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Regular security audits

## Known Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
This application uses multiple external services requiring API keys:
- Firebase (Client & Admin SDK)
- Clerk Authentication
- Resend Email Service
- hCaptcha
- MongoDB

**Always ensure these are properly secured and never committed to version control.**

### Admin Access
Admin functionality is protected by:
- Clerk authentication
- Role-based access control via Firestore
- API endpoint validation

### File Uploads
PDF uploads are:
- Limited to admin users only
- Stored in MongoDB GridFS
- Validated for file type and size

## Compliance

This application implements:
- **Authentication**: Multi-provider via Clerk
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Environment variable security
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation on all inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection
- **HTTPS**: Enforced in production

## Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

## Third-Party Security

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency audits via `npm audit`
- Automated security updates via Dependabot
- Trusted packages only

### External Services
- **Clerk**: SOC 2 Type II compliant
- **Firebase**: Google Cloud security standards
- **Vercel**: SOC 2 Type II compliant
- **MongoDB Atlas**: SOC 2 Type II compliant

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. **Assess** the scope and impact
2. **Contain** the threat immediately
3. **Document** the incident details
4. **Notify** affected users if necessary
5. **Fix** the vulnerability
