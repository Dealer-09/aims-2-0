# üîí AIMS 2.0 Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### Environment Variables & Secrets Protection
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive security patterns
- [x] Removed sensitive environment variables from `next.config.js`
- [x] Created secure `.env.example` template
- [x] Removed `pages/api/admin/config.json` from version control
- [x] Protected all API keys, secrets, and credentials

### Files Protected in .gitignore
- [x] All `.env*` files (including `.env.local`)
- [x] Firebase service account keys (`*firebase*admin*.json`)
- [x] Authentication secrets (Clerk, hCaptcha)
- [x] Database credentials (MongoDB connection strings)
- [x] Admin configuration files
- [x] SSL certificates and private keys
- [x] Development artifacts and caches

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED BEFORE PUBLISHING

### 1. **IMMEDIATE** - Remove .env.local from your local repository
```powershell
# Run this command to completely remove .env.local from git history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.local" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

### 2. **VERIFY** - Check for any exposed secrets
```powershell
# Search for potential secrets in tracked files
git ls-files | ForEach-Object { Select-String -Path $_ -Pattern "(sk_|pk_|re_|AIza|mongodb\+srv|-----BEGIN)" -CaseSensitive:$false }
```

### 3. **ROTATE ALL CREDENTIALS** (since they were exposed in .env.local)
- [ ] **Firebase API Key** - Generate new key in Firebase Console
- [ ] **Firebase Admin Private Key** - Generate new service account
- [ ] **Clerk Secret Key** - Regenerate in Clerk Dashboard
- [ ] **Resend API Key** - Create new API key in Resend
- [ ] **hCaptcha Secret Key** - Generate new secret in hCaptcha
- [ ] **MongoDB Password** - Change database user password

### 4. **UPDATE** - Environment Variables in Deployment
- [ ] Update Vercel environment variables with new credentials
- [ ] Ensure Vercel variables are marked as "secret" type
- [ ] Test deployment with new credentials

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

### Repository Settings
- [ ] Enable branch protection rules on main branch
- [ ] Require pull request reviews
- [ ] Enable secret scanning (GitHub Advanced Security)
- [ ] Set up Dependabot for dependency updates

### Runtime Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Use HTTPS only in production
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (don't expose stack traces)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up logging for security events
- [ ] Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- [ ] Implement alerting for failed authentication attempts

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Public
- [ ] All credentials rotated and updated
- [ ] .env.local removed from git history
- [ ] No secrets in tracked files
- [ ] Environment variables properly set in Vercel
- [ ] Security headers configured in `vercel.json`
- [ ] Firebase security rules properly configured

### After Publishing
- [ ] Monitor repository for any exposed secrets
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Regular security audits of dependencies
- [ ] Monitor application logs for security events

## üö® Emergency Response

If secrets are discovered after publication:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** rotate all affected credentials
2. **INVALIDATE** old keys/tokens in respective services
3. **CHECK** access logs for unauthorized usage
4. **UPDATE** deployment environment variables
5. **NOTIFY** users if data may be compromised
